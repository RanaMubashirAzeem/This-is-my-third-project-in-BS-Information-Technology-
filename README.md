# This-is-my-third-project-in-BS-Information-Technology-
This is a classic Ping Pong (Table Tennis) arcade game. I built this project to master real-time movement, paddle collision logic, and automated AI behavior for the opponent.
🎮 How to Play
Controls: Use the [Insert Keys: e.g., W/S or Arrow Keys] to move your paddle up and down.
Objective: Deflect the ball past the opponent’s paddle to score a point.
Winning: The first player to reach [Insert Score: e.g., 5 or 10] points wins the match!
✨ Key Features
Smooth Animation: High-frame-rate movement for the ball and paddles.
Smart AI: An automated opponent that tracks the ball's position.
Dynamic Physics: The ball increases speed over time to make the game more challenging.
Score Tracking: A live scoreboard to keep track of the match.
